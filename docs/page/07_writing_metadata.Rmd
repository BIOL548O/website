Metadata is _data about data_

## hand-made artisanal metadata

You can also do this simply by simple text (`.txt` or `.rtf`)  with your own hands:

![brom](../img/bromeliad_metadata.png)

Alternatively, you could write it in a CSV format:

```
field,description
country,"countries of the world""
continent,"continents of the world"
year,"the year AD"
lifeExp,"lifeExp in years"
pop,"population in humans"
gdpPercap,"gdp per capita, measured in PPP"
```

This is convenient, but has no standard whatsoever. This makes it difficult for machines to read. An increasing number of scientists are experimenting with new ways of creating metadata that satisfies our "write data for machines" principle. 

Many of these methods are novel, and rather experimental. We're going to be using some Very Modern Packages in today's exercises. We'll need to install versions of packages that are newer than what is available on CRAN (via `install.packages()`). 
```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
```

As usual, our gapminder dataset will supply some good examples:
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

## intro to JSON and XML (and YAML)

These are the two common languages of the internet: **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation and e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage. 

Here's an example of JSON: from [this wonderful site](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/chapter-3-data-formats/)

```javascript
{
  "crust": "original",
  "toppings": ["cheese", "pepperoni", "garlic"],
  "status": "cooking",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Brian",
    "phone": "573-111-1111"
  }
}
```
And here is XML:

```XML
<order>
    <crust>original</crust>
    <toppings>
        <topping>cheese</topping>
        <topping>pepperoni</topping>
        <topping>garlic</topping>
    </toppings>
    <status>cooking</status>
</order>
```

and finally, *Y*et *A*nother *M*arkup *L*anguage:

```
order:
  - crust: original
     topping: 
        - cheese
        - pepperoni
        - garlic
```



## the classic approach: the Ecological Metadata Language (`EML`)

EML is a classic metadata approach. There is a [large amount of documentation](http://im.lternet.edu/sites/im.lternet.edu/files/emlHandbook.pdf). 

See also the resources [here on the development website](https://ropensci.github.io/EML/).

```
devtools::install_github("ropensci/EML", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

```r
dat <- data.frame(river = factor(c("SAC",  
                                   "SAC",   
                                   "AM")),
                  spp   = c("Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",  
                            "Oncorhynchus tshawytscha", 
                            "Oncorhynchus kisutch"),
                  stg   = ordered(c("smolt", 
                                    "parr", 
                                    "smolt"), 
                                  levels=c("parr", 
                                           "smolt")), # => parr < smolt
                  ct    = c(293L,    
                            410L,    
                            210L),
                  day   = as.Date(c("2013-09-01", 
                                    "2013-09-1", 
                                    "2013-09-02")),
                  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

now we define the column units:

```r
col.defs <- c("River site used for collection",
              "Species scientific name",
              "Life Stage", 
              "count of live fish in traps",
              "The day on which traps were sampled")


unit.defs <- list(
  c(SAC = "The Sacramento River",     # Factor 
    AM = "The American River"),
 "Scientific name",                   # Character string 
  c(parr = "third life stage",        # Ordered factor 
    smolt = "fourth life stage"),
  c(unit = "number", 
    precision = 1, 
    bounds = c(0, Inf)),              # Integer
  c(format = "YYYY-MM-DD",            # Date
    precision = 1))
```

And finally, we write it out:

```r
eml_write(dat, 
          col.defs = col.defs, 
          unit.defs = unit.defs, 
          creator = "Carl Boettiger <cboettig@ropensci.org>", 
          file = "EML_example.xml")
```


## get the computer to write it: `CSVY`

CSVY is a new idea, that embeds the metadata file into the very `.csv` file. The whole idea is described on [csvy.org](http://csvy.org/). It uses a metadata standard called `YAML`:

```
---
name: my-dataset
fields:
  - name: var1
    title: variable 1
    type: string
    description: explaining var1
    constraints:
      - required: true
  - name: var2
    title: variable 2
    type: integer
  - name: var3
    title: variable 3
    type: number
---
var1,var2,var3
A,1,2.5
B,3,4.3
```

We're going to focus on this process, (but not on the constraints)

Let's start by using `rio` to write the data out:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rio)

attributes(gapminder)[1:2]

export(gapminder, "gapminder.csvy", format = "csvy", comment_header = FALSE)

head(import("gapminder.csvy"))
```

now let's edit it by hand.


### Note: the JSON table schema

```
 field     field
   |         |
   |         |
   V         V
 
  A     |    B    |    C    |    D      <--- Row
  ------------------------------------
  valA  |   valB  |  valC   |   valD    <--- Row
  ...

```
 
 We're going to work with **field descriptors**
 
```json
  "name": "name of field (e.g. column name)",
  "title": "A nicer human readable label or title for the field",
  "type": "A string specifying the type",
  "format": "A string specifying a format",
  "description": "A description for the field"
```

Note that there are no quotes when we use YAML.

## datapackage

Using the R package [`dmpr`](https://github.com/christophergandrud/dpmr). It creates data packages after the standard described in [datapackage](http://data.okfn.org/doc/tabular-data-package)

```r
#install.package("dpmr")

library(dpmr)
meta_list <- list(name = 'gapminder_data',
                    title = 'the data of Gapminder',
                    last_updated = Sys.Date(),
                    version = '0.1',
                    license = data.frame(type = 'PDDL-1.0',
                            url = 'http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/')
                            )

datapackage_init(df = gapminder, meta = meta_list) 

```
