# Now what

## Immediate plan

* Continuing with "Homework 2"
* Thursday lecture: assertions, metadata, data entry

# An approach to data cleaning

## What we talk about when we talk about data {.build}

We need to think about what we do when we do data cleaning. We're going to follow a simple procedure:

1. Looking at the data
1. Thinking about "what is this data good for" -- what will you _make_ with it
1. thinking about the steps needed to transform one into another (pseudocode)
1. exploring the tidyverse

# An in-class exercise

## how to clean up a dataset? 

form groups with your neighbours.   

Consider a dataset from `lecture_4_exercises` -- from the point of view of step **1 through 3** that is, what kind of rearrangement is necessary.


## Data workout

# Blank values & one-to-many


## One-to-many relationships are important in biology

cells / slides / bats

plants / half-sib fams / 


# not a rectangle

## irregularly-shaped data
(more like a snowflake)

* bird names

* Rhea's data

* Jasmin's data

the high vs the low approach

# Repeated measures in columns



## Alternate hw2

* what are you doing and why -- what calculations do you want to make later
* what columns should your new data have
* write some pseudocode to get there
