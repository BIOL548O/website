I want to cover three aspects of "making sure the data is true".

Right things going in -- Google forms and google sheets

right things going out -- assertr

what are these things even -- Metadata


slides --- make a slide for your project? I mean forms. make a form that is about your project? as if those data would be entered into it?


what validation would you use? what would be the types of questions -- mutliple choice, radio button
