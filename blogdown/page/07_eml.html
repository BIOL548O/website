<h3>Ecological metadata language</h3>
<p>Ecological Metadata Language is a very rigorous, and very complete, format for writing metadata. Because it is more specialized than the other two formats we have considered. As a result there is definitely more to know. But i think the effort is worth it, for two reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Because it is so specific to ecological/environmental applications, you can be very explicit about your metadata</li>
<li>Because it is supported by the <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/">Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity</a> which will host your data for free if it is documented this way.</li>
</ol>

<div id="writing-eml" class="section level2">
<h2>writing EML</h2>
<p>There are at least two ways of writing metadata. One is via <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools">Morpho</a> which is a Java-based application. To run this, you will need Java installed on your machine. Another way is via R, which is the means that we will use (because I am sure that we all already have R installed!)</p>
<p>We will use the R package <code>EML</code>. See the <a href="https://ropensci.github.io/EML/">ROpenSci tutorial here</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;ropensci/EML&quot;)

<div id="components-of-eml" class="section level2">
<h2>Components of EML</h2>
<p>EML is based on XML, and therefore has a nested structure. This is useful, because nested information is useful for describing a dataset. For example, if you have a column in your dataset that represents a factor (e.g. the factor “Nutrient addition”) this factor may contain several levels (e.g. “low” “medium” and “high”).</p>
<p>However, the nested structure of EML also imposes a small cost – it can be a little fiddley to set up. I think it might be helpful to divide the task up into some key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>dataTable</code></li>
<li>the contact information</li>
<li>coverage</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-datatable" class="section level3">
<h3>the <code>dataTable</code></h3>
<p>This part of the metadata is the most involved, so I am subdividitng this part into two halves:</p>
<div id="attributes" class="section level4">
<h4>attributes</h4>
<p>This is a dataframe that contains <strong>one row per column in the <code>.csv</code></strong> file. In other words, imagine the <code>.csv</code> file you are documenting as being <em>sideways</em>, and give each column a row in this new dataframe.</p>
<p>IN this example I am going to use a function from <code>dplyr</code> which you might not have seen, so I will describe it in a bit more detail. Normally, we create a data.frame in R in one of two ways: by reading a file directly in (e.g. via <code>read.csv</code>) and</p>
