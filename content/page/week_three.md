## Tuesday

How can you be sure that your data contain "sensible" numbers? That is, how can we get the computer to check for errors that might have been introduced during data entry, or by a malfunctioning instrument?

We can write [assertions](../06_assert) to test our data manually. 

### Peer Review 2 

Instructions on conducting Peer Review 2 [are here](../06_PeerReview_2).

## Thursday

What does your data say? How can you write down exactly what is in your dataset, for the benefit of 

1. yourself
1. future collaborators
1. total strangers
1. even computers!

The answer is to use a machine-readable **metadata** format. Metadata is "data about data", and in this lecture we will practice writing several types of machine-readable [metadata](../07_writing_metadata).

### Homework 3

In homework 3 you will apply these techinques to your own work! See these [etailed instructions](../07_Homework_3)
