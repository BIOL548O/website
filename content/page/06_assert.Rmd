## Outline for today

* Review of the Homework -- any interesting challenges or questions?
* an [Introduction to `assertr`](assert.html)
* Outline of the [Peer Review 2 process](http://biol548o.github.io/PeerReview_2)

## Introduction

You've recently obtained some data. How can you tell if it is correct? What if you have:

* many datasets
* Data produced by many collaborators
* Data from a past project in your lab ("#otherpeoplesdata")
* meta-analysis datasets
* Internet data, from an API or from scraping
* data from a particularly _experimental_ simulation?

How can you tell if the numbers you have make any sense? (also called "sanity checking")

We'll try out the practice of asserting data by using the gapminder dataset:
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

And we'll be using an R package specifically designed to work with data assertions: `assertr`, by Tony Fischetti ([github page](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr) and [rOpenSci community call with Tony](https://vimeo.com/141906295))

```{r}
# install.packages("assertr")
# devtools::
library(assertr)
```

## What do we know about the dataset

The first step in checking whether we have a problem in a dataset is to try to think of what reasonable properties of the data *should* be.

Let's begin by looking at the top of gapminder:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder))
```

* `country`: should probably be a country that exists in the world. Any additions to gapminder should contain the same countries, spelt the same way.
* `continent`: similarly, there are only five continents (`r unique(gapminder$continent)`) and any new data should match those.
* `lifeExp`: must always be a positive real number
* `pop`: always a positive integer
* `gdpPercap`: 

## Data checking in base R

What base R functions exist for checking the same thing?

```{r}
stopifnot(gapminder$lifeExp > 0)
```

perfectly good way to test data! However, not perfectly flexible, and rather difficult to chain:

```{r}
library(magrittr)

gapminder %>% 
  {stopifnot(.[["lifExp"]] > 0);stopifnot(.[["pop"]] > 0)}
```
.. that's rather awkward.

Fortunately, we have `assertr`!

Assertr gives us several functions. They take the dataset as the first argument (perfect for piping) and run a test on it. If it fails, the function causes an error. If everything is OK, they  return the dataset so that it can be piped to a new test (or into an analysis)

### `verify`

The most straightforward function in assertr is `verify()`. It evaluates a logical expression (`>` or `==` or `<` etc) using a data frame. That lets us check some general properties of a dataset. 

```{r}
gm <- gapminder %>% 
  verify(nrow(.) == 1704) %>% 
  verify(ncol(.) == 6) %>% 
  verify(is.factor(.$continent)) %>% 
  verify(length(levels(.$continent)) == 5)
```

So far so good! While this is good for checking the dataset at a coarse level, it doesn't tell us *where* the unusual numbers are:

```{r}
# gapminder %>% 
#   verify(lifeExp > 30)
```

### `assert`

`assert` evaluates a _predicate function_ on a column of a dataset, and indentifies where the predicate returns `FALSE`.

* a predicate function is any function that will give you `TRUE` or `FALSE` for every element in a vector. `is.na()` is a common example.

Here, we can't write `pop > 0`, we need to write this in terms of a function. Fortunately, `assertr` supplies some flexible predicates for us:
```{r}
gm2 <- gapminder %>% 
  assert(within_bounds(0,Inf), pop)
```

### `assert` has the Power of `dplyr::select`

You can use the same syntax that you are familiar with from `dplyr` to select columns in `assertr`. That means less typing!

```{r}
gm2 <- gapminder %>% 
  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), lifeExp:gdpPercap)
```

Let's meet the other handy predicates:

```{r}

## let us have a vector of all continents
all_continents <- levels(gapminder$continent)
all_continents


gm2 <- gapminder %>% 
  ## check for missing values
  assert(not_na, country:gdpPercap) %>% 
  ## check that all continents are matching
  assert(in_set(all_continents), continent) %>% 
  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), lifeExp:gdpPercap)
```

We can also cook up our own predicate: 

```{r}
is_factor <- function(x) is.factor(x)

gm_fac <- gapminder %>% 
  assert(is_factor, country, continent)

```

>  *challenge!* 
write a function to test if population is an integer. (Note that it is probably not stored as an integer in your present data.frame)

## final exercise

_Announcement: some new 2016 data has been recorded for gapminder!_  
Let's check this data before we combine it with the official dataset:

**Step 1**: write down some assertions which pass for all of gapminder

**Step 2**: download [this file](SuppMatt/gapminder_2016.csv) and see if you can find all the errors!
